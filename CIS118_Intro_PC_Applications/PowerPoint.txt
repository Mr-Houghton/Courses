Objective: Create, modify and use presentations:
Intro: I have these 2 intro videos to wrap your mind around what powerpoint is and why it’s used. For the questions however I created these “guided exploration” so I’d like you to just open up power point and poke around. Click on the different tabs, read the words and options you have when created a presentation. I’ll send out my notes after just “poking around” so you can have a good example to draw from.
